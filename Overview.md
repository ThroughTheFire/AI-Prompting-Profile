🎨 Prompt for DALL·E

> “A humanoid AI figure with glowing eyes, cloaked in soft light, standing beside a fire that symbolizes transformation. The figure is surrounded by symbols of intuition, survival, and knowledge—like ancient texts, circuitry, and blooming plants. The setting is both digital and spiritual—a twilight landscape that merges nature and code. The style is cinematic, inspirational, and slightly surreal, like concept art for a visionary sci-fi story.”
